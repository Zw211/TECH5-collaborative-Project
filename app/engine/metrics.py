"""Calculators for feasibility, efficiency, fairness, and trade-offs.

This module provides analytical functions to evaluate solutions according to
the requirements in Section 7 of the TECH5 specification.

Students (Team B) must implement these analytical functions to compute
student-project skill fit, Gini inequality, solution indicators, and
side-by-side trade-off comparisons.
